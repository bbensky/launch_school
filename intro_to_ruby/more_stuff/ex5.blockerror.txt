def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

Error:

block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'

To have a block passed as a paramter in a method, the variable in parens must be preceded by an ampersand.
The code must look like this to execute properly:

def execute(&block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }
