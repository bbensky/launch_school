'SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
    from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

#This means that a ')' character was in the wrong place,
#and that the computer expected a '}' instead. What likely
#happened was that an opening bracket '{' wasn't closed, and 
#perhaps a ')' was entered by mistake.
