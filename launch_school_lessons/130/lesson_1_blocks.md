Closures in Ruby

**Closure** - programming concept that lets programmers save chunks of code
            - closures bind surrounding artifacts, like variables, methods
              objects
            - the artifacts can be referenced when a closure is executed
            - some languages call closures 'anonymous functions' b/c they
              don't have explicit names (like methods)

`Proc` object - how closures are implemented in Ruby

How to work with closures in Ruby:

1) Instantiate an object from the `Proc` class

2) lambdas

3) blocks
