Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 

*If at the end of a method name, they are just part of the syntax and don't have any defined impact on the method.

Explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?

This means 'not equals', and it should be used as part of a condition that evaluates to true when two objects don't have equivalent values.

2. put ! before something, like !user_name

This is equivalent to 'not user_name', if user_name evaluates to true or false, this would be the opposite.

* This turns an object into the opposite of its boolean equivalent.

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!

This shows that the method mutates the object that it is being called on.

4. put ? before something

This is part of a ternary operator, and the code directly after the ? is returned if the code before the ? evaluates to true.

5. put ? after something

This means that a method returns a true or false value.

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

This is a double-negative.

* This turns an object into its boolean equivalent.
