1.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

Breakfast
It's what the program returned when it ran.

2.

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal

Evening
It's the last expression evaluated in the method.

3.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal

Breakfast
The method specifically says to return that object,
and return exits a method.

4. 

def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

Dinner
Breafast
The method says to print Dinner, but it also says to return Breakfast.

5. 

def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal

Dinner
nil

The meal method prints 'Dinner' when called. And because we are using p, it will also print nil, which is the return value of puts.

6.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal

Breakfast
Return exits the method, returning the value Breakfast.

7.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep

0
1
2
3
4
5

When called, the #times method will print 0 to 4. #times also returns the integer that it's called on, so 5 will also be printed.

8.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
  10
end

puts count_sheep

0
1
2
3
4
10

This will print out values from the #times method, as well as the last evaluated result
of the method, in this case the last line.

9.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep

0
1
2
nil

The method will print numbers up to 2. Once it passes the conditional expression, it exits the program. Because return was not provided a value it returns nil.

10.

def tricky_number
  if true
    number = 1
  else
    2
  end
end

puts tricky_number

1

Methods default as true, and by passing the if statement, the last evaluated result is 'number = 1'. 1 is the last value evaluated so it is returned.
